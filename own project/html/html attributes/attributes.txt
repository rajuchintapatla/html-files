HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
>>>>(The lang Attribute)
The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.

The language is declared with the lang attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>

...

</body>
</html>
The first two letters specify the language (en). If there is a dialect, use two more letters (US).<<<



>>>>The title Attribute
Here, a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">
This is a paragraph.
</p>                <<<<<<<



>>>>>The href Attribute
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
<<<<<<<<



>>>>>>Size Attributes
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The filename of the source (src), and the size of the image (width and height) are all provided as attributes:

Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142">
<<<<<<<


>>>>>>The alt Attribute
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
<<<<<<<



>>>>>Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
<<<<<<<




>>>>>Summary
All HTML elements can have attributes
The title attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
The href attribute provides address information for links
The width and height attributes provide size information for images
The alt attribute provides text for screen readers
At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names
At W3Schools we always quote attribute values with double quotes
